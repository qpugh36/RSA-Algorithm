#RSA Algorithm Implementations
This repository contains implementations of the RSA algorithm in three different programming languages: C#, Python, and Java.

The RSA algorithm is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that is used for secure data transmission. The algorithm is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers, making it a very secure method for encrypting and decrypting data.

#C# Implementation
The C# implementation of the RSA algorithm is provided in the RSA.cs file. The implementation uses the System.Numerics namespace to perform arithmetic operations on large integers. The Random class is used to generate random prime numbers and exponents. The implementation includes a GenerateKeys method to generate the public and private keys, an Encrypt method to encrypt a message, and a Decrypt method to decrypt a ciphertext.

To use the C# implementation, create an instance of the RSA class and call the Encrypt and Decrypt methods to encrypt and decrypt messages, respectively.

#Python Implementation
The Python implementation of the RSA algorithm is provided in the rsa.py file. The implementation uses the math.gcd function to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers, and the Crypto.Util.number module to generate random prime numbers and exponents. The implementation includes a generate_keys function to generate the public and private keys, an encrypt function to encrypt a message, and a decrypt function to decrypt a ciphertext.

To use the Python implementation, create an instance of the RSA class and call the encrypt and decrypt methods to encrypt and decrypt messages, respectively.

#Java Implementation
The Java implementation of the RSA algorithm is provided in the RSA.java file. The implementation uses the java.math.BigInteger class to perform arithmetic operations on large integers, and the java.util.Random class to generate random prime numbers and exponents. The implementation includes a GenerateKeys method to generate the public and private keys, an Encrypt method to encrypt a message, and a Decrypt method to decrypt a ciphertext.

To use the Java implementation, create an instance of the RSA class and call the Encrypt and Decrypt methods to encrypt and decrypt messages, respectively.

#Conclusion
These implementations demonstrate how the RSA algorithm can be implemented in different programming languages. The implementations are provided for educational purposes only and should not be used in production systems without careful review and testing.
